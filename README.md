# burger - Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it will display on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The burger will be stored in a database, whether devoured or not.

Followed the MVC design pattern - used Express, Node, MySQL and a homemade ORM to query and route data, Handlebars to generate HTML.
